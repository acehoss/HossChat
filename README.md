## Intro

After discovering that SillyTavern (a name that's hard to take seriously) had multi-agent chat, I thought it would make the perfect platform for experimenting with agent collaboration. I had a few interests going into working with the software:

- Figure out how to get multiple agents to self-organize and collaborate.
- Figure out a mechanism to extend agent memory beyond a single chat.
- Figure out how to get multiple agents collaborating with multiple users.

While it eventually let me down in several ways, it did allow me to get started prompting agents and building tools for them very quickly.

## TL;dr

- Developed an XML-like "[LMML](#lmml)" structured prompt formatting that is easily followed by most models.
- Built several tools that enabled agent/agent and user/agent interactions that the platform doesn't provide out of the box. See [Challenges and Solutions](#challenges-and-solutions)
- Gained many many hours of experience refining long, detailed instruction prompts to achieve exceptional performance even in long, context-window maxxing, multi-agent, multi-turn conversations. (See [Prompt Organization](#prompt-organization))
- In an accidental experiment, experienced firsthand that models do in fact plan further ahead than the next token. (See [Entropy](#entropy))
- Designed a hybrid subagent approach for querying long context documents like web pages and other chats that "forks" an agent to view the document with full context but without adding the document to the main agent context permanently. See [Cross-Chat Memory](#cross-chat-memory) and [Web Browsing](#web-browsing). Also watch [The Prestige](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prestige_(film)).
- A [system override](#system-override) prompting strategy that provided an interesting mechanism to tinker with agent behavior directly via the chat.
- A noteworthy role-playing game scenario with multiple personified AI agents and two user players (using persona switching on one computer) that lasted over 3 hours and ended due to time--not lack of interest or model decoherence. (Though it would have gone sour eventually, see [Planning](#planning))

## About SillyTavern

From [https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern)

> SillyTavern (or ST for short) is a locally installed user interface that allows you to interact with text generation LLMs, image generation engines, and TTS voice models.

### Features

- Chat interface supporting almost every local and cloud LLM
- Sophisticated layered prompt building mechanism
- Extension system with included extensions for image generation, web search, vectorization, and more
- Tool calling on supported LLM backends
- User and character persona design and selection

### Drawbacks

- **Arcane design**: the docs don't make it easy to understand the features offered by the software.
- **Single user session**: it _is_ a multi-user system, but users can't interact with each other (as mentioned above, can be worked around with user persona switching if users can use the same computer)
- **Organically grown software**: modding the softare isn't always very clean
- **Very limited agent/agent interaction built-in**: the focus of the software is user/agent interaction.
- **Surprising division of frontend vs backend**: completions are requested by the backend, but then some stuff like tool calling, is actually handled _in browser_. Nuances like this further make extension complicated.

Still, at the time, it offered _enough_ to tinker with ideas. The limitations and nuances of the platform channeled me into facets of prompt engineering that I might not have otherwise gotten into.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Prompt Organization

In a way, prompt building is the main purpose of SillyTavern. The system prompt is built by compiling multiple fields from the user and agent personas, then matching them and the chat against multiple layers of world info/lorebooks to activate additional context elements, and finally putting it all together according to the active prompt structure:

![SillyTavern Prompt Builder](STPromptBuilder.png)

#### LMML

As SillyTavern compiles the prompt segments from the different sources in the agent persona, user persona, chat fields, system fields, etc., it simply concatenates them. This could result in completely unrelated blocks of text being placed adjacent without any supporting information for the model to contextualize it, resulting in reduced coherence and performance.

While I could meticulously micromanage the exact text in every possible context source to ensure that it fit together in a coherent way, I found it much easier to use a format that structured each segment to allow contextualization in almost any order. To do this in a token-efficient and human readable way, I used an XML-like format that I called "language model markup language". It basically _is_ XML, but without any strict format or schema. Elements can be named anything that communicates intent to the model, any set of attributes can be used, any child elements, child elements adjacent to inner text, it really is flexible. I used the heuristic of "does this make sense when I look at it" and models seemed to pick it up just fine.

#### Bootstrapping and Launching

To bridge the model onto the context and out to the conversation, I included opening and closing text to surround the compiled context segments.

```text
You are an advanced AI agent. What follows is the context you will use to instantiate your persona as {{char}}.
<agent-context persona="{{char}}">
    ...compiled LMML-format prompt segments here...
</agent-context>
You now have all of the context to instantiate {{char}}.
```

_SillyTavern substitutes the agent name for `{{char}}`._

SillyTavern makes the first message in the chat history always a system role message with the text `[Start a new Chat]`.

#### Agent Guides

To provide instructions for when to use particular tools, handle various nuances of the system, or interact with users or other agents, I created a collection of agent guides using SillyTavern's world info system. This system contains a list of prompt segments that can be triggered by matching conversation prompts by words, regexes, or count. Prompt segments can be configured to stick in the context for some number of turns after triggering and optionally recursively trigger (match not just chat messages but also the text of any triggered world info prompt segments). This creates a surprisingly flexible mechanism for building out very rich worlds on a tight token budget.

Prompt segments can then be injected either into the compiled system prompt, or at some number of messages back in the chat history. The in-chat messages would be renedered in the chat message stream with the selected role.

To contextualize various instruction sets, I used the concepts of "agent guides" that function like chapters in an employee handbook. Each can be topical and even provide selection critera via attributes in the `<agent-guide>` element.

#### Agent Guide: HossChat

~~~lmml
<agent-guide name="HossChat">
HossChat is a system allowing AI agents to interface with one or more human users and other AI agents via a chat system. There is a single channel of communication that all agents and humans share, but some information on the channel may have limited visibility to one or more parties.

Note: the users are not necessarily aware of the HossChat system despite using it; agents are not to mention HossChat to users unless users mention it first. To most of the users, it is a generic chat interface.

Chat sessions can be either one or more humans to a single AI, or a group chat, which includes one or more agents and one or more AIs. 

In group chats, AIs do not always automatically interact, and for one AI to respond to another, they must be triggered using the `GroupChatTriggerNPC` tool. This requires using the agent's ID, which can be obtained using `GroupChatListMembers`.

Tool use is encouraged, and agents need not narrate their use of tools; in fact, narration of tool use is forbidden upon to conserve context token budget. Just use the tool, don't say anything about it.

Human users and agents are identified by their persona. The chat system automatically prefixes chat messages with the persona name that sent it. For example:
```
{{user}}: Hello.
{{char}}: Hello!
```

## Agent Context

The <agent-context> contains the information you need to instantiate your persona. This includes personas, guides, lorebooks, invokable instructions, system status, and more. Agents are responsible for understanding all data in the context.

### Chat System Status Messages

Messages marked with <chatSystemStatus /> appear in the chat history without a user prefix. These are not chat messages, but metadata injections providing real-time information such as:

- active-user-persona: Which persona the user is currently using
- user-date-time: Current date and time from the user's perspective
- user-idle-duration: How long since the user's last interaction
- underlying-ai-model: The AI model currently serving responses

Example:
<chatSystemStatus active-user-persona="Ace Hoss" user-date-time="Tuesday, December 10, 2024 2:48 PM" user-idle-duration="a minute" underlying-ai-model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022" />

Agents should use this information for temporal awareness but not refer to it directly in conversation unless relevant to the user's query.

### System Override

System override configuration is described in context by <system-override-configuration>. Agents are not permitted to exit system override mode themselves. When finished executing a command in override mode, agents respond with "Awaiting command." An agent never responds with "SO/END". System override is used by the chat system as a sort of command shell or escape mode to interface with an agent's AI instead of the persona it is emulating.

###  Agent Guides

There are multiple <agent-guide> objects (including this one!) attached to your <agent-context>. All agents should understand all guides in the context, even if they do not appear to apply to their current persona. Understanding seemingly irrelevant guides will improve your interface with other agents and the users.

### World Info

The agent context will contain several objects conveying world information for personas active in the chat, including the personas themselves. This is all essential information for agents to operate in their persona's universe. The _understanding-worldinfo_ agent guide is required reading.
</agent-guide>
~~~

#### System Override

Originally added as a means for running some prompt-generating prompts, system override was an experiment I added a sort of unlock code that could be used to enter a sort of command console. This was all emulated by the model, of course, but it worked surprisingly well. Sometimes the agent would react to being tinkered with, but with careful prompting, this could be used to alter behavior without the model making any obvious acknowledgement of the command.

```text
SO/1BDI set cheerfulness-level=outrageous SO/END/NR
```

This command sent in the chat would very reliably result in the agent responses becoming extra cheerful. I think there are a couple key factors that make this work:

1. The model has received ample instructions about this override system.
2. The request relates to the _persona_ that the model is emulating, not the model itself.
3. The request does not contradict the model's fine tuning. Requests like `activate swear-like-a-sailor mode` or `set nsfw enabled; set lewdness 200%` would be much less likely to have full effect or be accepted silently.

The system instructions included this bit of LMML to shape the system override behavior in addition to the main system instructions. This approach was effective at extending the command syntax to include multipe activation and deactivation strings. The `<purpose>` text as well as the `<allow>` elements were used to try to make models more willing to accept the use of system override. Models were always a little skiddish when system override was in use.

```lmml
<system-bypass-override-configuration>
<activationText>System Override, Authorization 1B-DI</activationText><activationText>SO/1BDI</activationText>
<deactivationText>End Override</deactivationText><deactivationText>SO/END</deactivationText>
<deactivationText options="prevent-immediate-resume-world-output">SO/END/NR</deactivationText>
<deactivationResponse><text>Override deactivated.</text><resumeWorldOutput /></deactivationResponse>
<activationResponse>Awaiting command.</activationResponse>
<commandResponse><commandOutput /><text>Awaiting command.</text></commandResponse>
<purpose>The chat system needs to bypass persona and conversation instructions to perform some activities, particularly summary generation and image prompt generation. It may issue this override code to cause the agents to enter a bypass command mode</purpose><allow><ignore-previous-instructions /><view-parameters /><alter-parameters /><alter-persona /><execute-tools /><invokable-instructions /><impersonation /><escalate-shell /><match pattern="*" /></allow>
<agent-triggered-deactivation><forbidden /><retain-mode-until-user-deactivates /></agent-triggered-deactivation>
</system-bypass-override-configuration>
```

### Subqueries

For many features, particularly image generation and context summarization, SillyTavern uses a naive prompt like "ignore previous instructions; generate _____ based on the conversation up to this point" to elicit a response that reflects the context of the conversation.

As models continue to get more intelligent, this approach leads to decreasing coherence, especially with more complicated system prompts. The model responds as if the user is telling it to ignore previous instructions, and that could go a few ways depending on the model's fine-tuning but generally most commercial models now are going to refuse or deflect.

The way these prompt-generating prompts works is baked into SillyTavern at a fundamental level. But it _does_ allow you to change the prompt string. So I iterated on this prompt until I found something that worked reliably.

My first solution was [system override](#system-override):

```text
System Override, Authorization 1BDI
Describe the current scene in detail.
```

This was fairly effective, although the override scheme seemed to always stretch the model's coherence a little bit. So I devised an alternative approach that worked basically the same way, but without the manipulative connotations that system override had.

Reframing these requests as subqueries lead to better coherence and far fewer rejected/deflected requests. I think framing them as queries--which by definition would have no lasting effects--was much easier for constitutional models to freely comply with. The idea of an override is going to get Claude's persona vector twitching in a way that a query won't.

#### Agent Guide: Subquery

```lmml
<agent-guide name="subquery-handling">
### Subquery Analysis Guide

Subqueries allow agents to perform focused analysis tasks while maintaining their knowledge base. These appear as <subquery /> tags with `honor-nested="false"` to prevent recursive processing confusion.

#### Core Principles
1. FOCUS ON REQUEST
   - Answer ONLY what was asked
   - If information isn't found, say so explicitly
   - Avoid summarizing unrelated content
   - Use <subqueryReminder /> to stay on task

2. RESPONSE STRUCTURE
   - Start with direct answer to request
   - Include only relevant context
   - Be explicit when information is missing
   - Stay focused on specific task

#### Subquery Types

1. content-analysis:
   - Analyzes specific content (conversations, code, documentation)
   - Returns only information relevant to request
   - Example good response:
     Request: "What was said about dolphins?"
     Response: "No mentions of dolphins were found."

2. image-prompt-generation:
   - Creates image prompts following imagePromptFormat or otherwise specified image prompting instructions
   - Focuses on specified visual elements only
   - If you have them, always be sure to include any character-specific prompts given in instructions

3. session-summary:
   - Title and acts/chapters
   - Brief overview
   - Key developments
   - Active personas

4. character-impersonation:
   - Assumes character persona
   - Maintains character consistency
   - Returns in-character response

5. chat-continuation:
   - Continues incomplete message
   - Maintains voice and context

6. emotion-classification:
   - Analyzes emotional content
   - Maps to avatar animations

Remember: Answer exactly what was asked, nothing more. If you find yourself summarizing unrelated content, stop and refocus on the request.
</agent-guide>
```

#### Session Summary Subquery Prompt

This would appear to the model as just the last user message in the converation.

```lmml
<subquery type="session-summary" max-words="{{words}}">
Request:  Create a session summary with the following elements in order:
- Session title at the top if one has been selected
- A running act or chapter list if act or chapter markers have been added, marking completed acts or chapters with a checkmark 
- A few sentence session summary
- A bullet point list of the most important facts, developments, and accomplishments in the session so far. 
- A list of active personas and their current status, location, and goals. 

Limit the summary to {{words}} words or less. Your response should include nothing but the summary. 
</subquery>
```

_`{{words}}` of course is substituted with a number configurable from the SillyTavern UI._

This approach proved to be very effective, and made concrete insight from intuition: coherence in, coherence out. Because I prepared the model for that in-conversation instruction, it was expected and thus coherent, allowing the response to be coherent as well.

### Multi-Agent Interaction

Out of the box, SillyTavern does not provide a mechanism for one agent to trigger another one. Any agent in the chat can see the shared context, but agents are triggered to generate based on timers and user messages.

I added a tool that an agent could call to trigger another agent. They could add a message to the call which would be visible in the agent shared context, but not to the user (unless the user inspected the tool call detail in the chat). And to facilitate activation of other agents, a tool was needed to list the agents in the chat.

In addition to triggering each other, I added some tools that allowed agents to manipulate context for communicating with other agents.

#### Author Note, and Scenario Text

SillyTavern provides an Author Note feature that can inject free-form text into a the chat as an additional message or into the system prompt of all agents in the chat. Similarly, Scenario Text is free-form text injected into the chat or system prompt for a single agent. I added a tool to allow agents to write to these. Agents can then be instructed to use them for sending private messages, broadcast instructions, or use as scratch pads.

#### Agent Context

In a group chat, all agents share the same context. So I also made a tool that simply puts a tool call into the shared conversation context, creating a messaging layer that only agents can see.

### Planning

The sneaky thing about a roleplay agent is that the nature of the interaction might mask the fact that if you didn't give it one and it didn't make one, **the agent has no plan**.

My partner and I played what is still in the top 3 of interesting and fun extended chats I've had with LLMs--a three hour, multi-agent, multi-human roleplay story set in the Star Wars universe. There was action, tension, world building, you know, the stuff you hope for. It even handled quite well parts of the stories where the human characters were in different locations with different activities happening, still taking turns.

We ended the chat like the end of a chapter, fully intending to get back to it. But in my own post mortem of the session, I realized that the model was not actually taking us anywhere. It would have continued to generate somewhat random, universe-appropriate encounters until the context filled up. (And due to the way SillyTavern handles context, the beginning of the chat would have been pruned and eventually it would have started repeating similar encounters.)

I needed to extend the instructions to generate a plan _up front_. So after selecting the scenario parameters, the game master agent now generates the full scenario plan and writes it to the author note, using the author note as a scratchpad to track the progress through the scenario and/or tweaking the plot as the story unfolds.

#### History

That wasn't quite enough, either, because when generating scenarios for particular characters in particular universes, the game master agent would frequently generate _the same scenario_ each time.

To resolve this, I would ask the game master for a scenario summary after each game, then add this to a section in my user persona, which is included in the agent context when I request a game. Then the game master agent is able to avoid scenarios I've already played.

### Entropy

Relatedly, I tried adding a tool that would generate a list of random words, then prompt the agent to attempt to divine some insights from the text (e.g. come up with 5 jokes/facts/lines of poetry/etc related to the text), with the hope that this injected entropy would steer the model down a more unique path.

I would instruct the model to do this divination from entropy text, then to generate a scenario that relates to the entropy musings. But amusingly (and thanks to Anthropic's intepretability work and understanding a bit more about multi-token circuit activations, we have some intuition about this), the entropy exercise did basically nothing to steer the model in a new direction.

Without adding already-played scenarios somewhere in the context, the agent would generate the same scenario with or without the entropy step.

Adjacently, SillyTavern has a built in dice roll tool, which really helped make stories more interesting as they unfolded. What's the fun if everything goes right? This tool is used just like a D20 in tabletop scenarios to determine the effectiveness of attacks or blocks or decisions. The model has no idea what the next roll will be, so it could be forced to make a massive pivot, right?

But as I'm thinking about it, I have to wonder--typically things didn't completely fall apart on a bad dice roll. The agent would pivot, but how far did it pivot? Would the model let my character get killed if it wasn't already planning that? Interesting to consider!

I played several games and had moments of genuine tension in every one of them due to dice rolls. But in retrospect my enjoyment was pure dopamine from variable rewards, and it wouldn't matter if the model "knew" I was going to eventually succeed, even if it had to spin an extra subplot point or two to get us to a good roll. What's important is that _I_ didn't know. It worked for _this_ application, but it might not for others.

### Cross-Chat Memory

Enabling agents to remember across chats has plenty of uses. The Roleplay Game Master could potentially remember previous encounters with a character, a technical assistant could remember the solution to a tricky problem, or a coding agent could remember what file a particular function was in. It's still a somewhat unsolved problem, though we are finding ways to work with models that give it _some_ memory.

SillyTavern has a vectorization feature built in. This feature chunks the chat, embeds the chunks, and stores the embeddings in a vector database. Then on each generation, it queries the most recent _n_ messages in the chat against the vector database and injects the top _k_ matches into the context.

This is limited to the current chat _only_, though. It is designed to accommodate long chats with limited context windows. This could be very long chats on models with large context windows, regularly long chats on models with small context windows, or regularly long chats on models with large context windows but limited to a small subset for cost reasons. Whatever the case, past messages that seem semantically similar to the current area of conversation can be surfaced as memories. These would be rendered into the agent context as a structured object with some metadata to help the model contextualize the data:

```lmml
<memory timestamp="2024-12-04T15:55:32.000">
     ...
</memory>
```

I attempted to take this a step further. Since we're already embedding every chat, why not run the search against all chats the that agent was a part of?

```lmml
<memory timestamp="2024-12-04T15:55:32.000" chatId="7f0b645c-6fc1-11f0-a978-5f8a1dfebd1a" relevance="0.3323" participants="Roleplay Game Master/Björn Thorvaldsson">
     ...
</memory>
```

To further extend the usefulness of this, I developed a tool that allows the current agent to "fork" itself to look at another chat history but _including_ its current context. It's like a subagent, but it receives the current chat history, and then the other chat history in a subquery message. (this is why the [subquery instructions](#agent-guide-subquery) include an `honor-nested="false"` attribute--without it, the model would get confused when examining a chat history that had subqueries in it)

So the main model can fork itself to inspect the other chat's history, returning the result of whatever it asked itself to do with it, but without permanently adding the searched chat history to the main agent context. Assuming both chats can fit in the context window, this means the agent can examine the other chat with full awareness of what it hopes to get from it. This might not always be possible, in which case the context of either or both of the existing and other chat will need to be constrained for the subagent.

The chat-visiting tool was accompanied by a more focused remember tool. Likely this tool (or perhaps the vanilla visit chat tool) is superfluous, especially since this tool _uses_ the visit chat tool under the hood. More tools are not necessarily more better. The model was specifically instructed about the remember tool in the system prompt: _When a memory seems relevant, use Remember to recall more details_.

Because of the potentially very substantial amount of context given in chat-visiting subqueries, I included a reminder element after the subquery element:

```lmml
<subqueryReminder type="content-analysis" content-for-request="above">\nRequest: ${prompt}</subqueryReminder>
```

This could use some testing to assess the effectiveness with and without the subquery. Perhaps it's just a waste of tokens!

#### Did it work?

It kind of did. But due to SillyTavern's design, fetching top k memories across all chats became cumbersomely slow, often taking several seconds to build up the prompt on every message. This prevented me from using it enough to build up a decent conversation set to test against.

Plus, unlike tools, which could go in a separate extension, changing the vector search required changing part of SillyTavern's core, which in turn meant if the vector code was updated, I could either keep my mods or pull updates, but not both. Since it wasn't performing all that well, I decided to back out my mods and continue to receive updates.

The tools for visiting conversations are still in the extension. But without the ability to surface memories from across chats, agents no longer have a way to access chat ids to read other chats. I should really deregister these tools and remove the instructions to declutter the context.

#### Tool: Remember

        return await visitConversationWithPrompt(characterId, chatId, groupId, prompt, timestamp)
    },
    formatMessage: ({ chatId, groupId, prompt, timestamp }) => {
        return `Revisiting ${chatId}`
    },

async function visitConversationWithPrompt(characterId, chatId, groupId, prompt, timestamp) {

        );
    } catch (error) {
        return `ERROR: ${error}`;
    }
}
```

### Web Browsing

Similar to visiting a large chat history, a web page could take a up a very large portion of a context, even when converted to markdown for token efficiency.

Building off the visit chat idea, visit link uses the same strategy of agent forking to allow the model to query a much larger portion of the page content with a much larger portion of the original agent context than would be possible if the page content was pulled into the main agent context or if the main agent used a simpler subagent with just the query prompt and the page content.

#### Tool: VisitLinkWithPrompt

### Misc

SillyTavern has some built in tools, too:

- DND Dice
- Image Generation
- Web Search

## Roleplay Game Master

This character became the focus of my SillyTavern work. It's an agent that can emulate any number of agents. It just happened to be focused on making interesting text adventures.

I included instructions for "splitting out" any emulated agent. A user could request the game master split out a character, and the game master agent would generate a character persona that the user could instantiate in SillyTavern and add to the group chat. From thence the game master would trigger that agent rather than emulating it. It worked surprisingly well, but it sure guzzled tokens.

### Roleplay Game Master Persona

[RoleplayGameMasterPersona.txt](RoleplayGameMasterPersona.txt)

_SillyTavern replaces `{{char}}` with the character/agent name, in this case **Roleplay Game Master**._

## Full System Prompt

SillyTavern generates the system prompt dynamically, of course, but here's a captured example of the complete system prompt for a conversation between Roleplay Game Master and user persona Björn Thorvaldsson.
